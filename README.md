# Pulsar Class Prediction

### Project Overview
Pulsars are a rare type of Neutron star that produce radio emission detectable here on Earth. They are of great scientific interest as probes of space-time, the interstellar medium, and states of matter.

As search surveys increase in sensitivity, we observe more "candidates" that must be classified as either real pulsars or interference (RFI/noise). This project implements a classification model to automate the detection of pulsar candidates using signal characteristics.
